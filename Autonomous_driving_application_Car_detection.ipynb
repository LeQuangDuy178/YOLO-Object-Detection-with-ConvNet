Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: [Redmon et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and [Redmon and Farhadi, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242). \n",

    "**By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect objects in a car detection dataset\n",
    "- Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy\n",
    "- Implement intersection over union\n",
    "- Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning\n",

    "- This code uses the convention that (0,0) is the top-left corner of an image, (1,0) is the upper-right corner, and (1,1) is the lower-right corner. In other words, the (0,0) origin starts at the top left corner of the image. As x increases, you move to the right.  As y increases, you move down.\n",
    "- For this exercise, a box is defined using its two corners: upper left $(x_1, y_1)$ and lower right $(x_2,y_2)$, instead of using the midpoint, height and width. This makes it a bit easier to calculate the intersection.\n",
    "- To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply its height $(y_2 - y_1)$ by its width $(x_2 - x_1)$. Since $(x_1,y_1)$ is the top left and $x_2,y_2$ are the bottom right, these differences should be non-negative.\n",
    "- To find the **intersection** of the two boxes $(xi_{1}, yi_{1}, xi_{2}, yi_{2})$: \n",
    "    - Feel free to draw some examples on paper to clarify this conceptually.\n",
    "    - The top left corner of the intersection $(xi_{1}, yi_{1})$ is found by comparing the top left corners $(x_1, y_1)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex that has an x-coordinate that is closer to the right, and y-coordinate that is closer to the bottom.\n",
    "    - The bottom right corner of the intersection $(xi_{2}, yi_{2})$ is found by comparing the bottom right corners $(x_2,y_2)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex whose x-coordinate is closer to the left, and the y-coordinate that is closer to the top.\n",
    "    - The two boxes **may have no intersection**.  You can detect this if the intersection coordinates you calculate end up being the top right and/or bottom left corners of an intersection box.  Another way to think of this is if you calculate the height $(y_2 - y_1)$ or width $(x_2 - x_1)$ and find that at least one of these lengths is negative, then there is no intersection (intersection area is zero).  \n",
    "    - The two boxes may intersect at the **edges or vertices**, in which case the intersection area is still zero.  This happens when either the height or width (or both) of the calculated intersection is zero.\n",
